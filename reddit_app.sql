As much as we love answering questions here, it doesn\'t help when we see repeat questions on the front page every day. You can find the questions that have come up here again and again in our [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq).\n\n#Rule 3: Follow reddiquette \n\nBe polite and respectful in your exchanges. NSQ is supposed to be a helpful resource for confused redditors. Civil disagreements can happen, but insults should not. Personal attacks, slurs, bigotry, etc. are not permitted at any time.\n\nCheck out the [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) page for more info - violations of any of those of clauses may result in a ban without warning. \n\n#Rule 4: No medical advice questions\n\nNo medical advice questions\n\n#Rule 5: No trolling or joke questions\n\nDisallowed: questions that are joke or trolling questions, memes, just song lyrics as title, etc.\n\n#Rule 6: No suicide or \'was I raped/sexual assaulted/sexually harrassed?\' questions\n\nSuicide related questions are best handled by the resources they have at r/SuicideWatch.\n\nQuestions along the lines of \"was I raped?\" or \"was I sexually assaulted?\" are best addressed by the trained, professional support resources you can find here or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrewsCrew/wiki/help).\n\n#Rule 7: No self-promotion, shilling or begging\n\nNo trying to draw traffic to product/video/podcast/website by phrasing it in the form of a question.\n\nAsking for upvotes, birthday wishes, handouts, or fundraising support fall under this as well. Please see more appropriate subreddits for that.\n\n#Rule 8: No illegal/unethical or disturbing subject matter\n\nNothing like \"Where can I find a copy of (movie/show/music) for free online?\" There are other places for asking that, this is not one of them.\n\nTasteless or disturbing questions regarding loli, pedophilia, murder, violence or other sketchy or disgusting subject matter are not welcome here. You are welcome to ask good faith questions about such topics but be aware such threads may be locked or removed if necessary to preserve the integrity of the subreddit.\n\n#Rule 9: No disguised rants, agenda posts, potstirring, disruptive topics\n\nQuestions not asked in good faith - such as a rant or hate towards any group in the form of a question, as well as leading questions, or those asked merely to promote an agenda will be removed.\n\nWe are a small, volunteer mod team and there is a limit to our ability to respond to brigading and trolling from Reddit at large.

Be Civil\n\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\n\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don\'t insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don\'t lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don\'t be an asshole.\n\n##2. Voting Rules\n\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. **DON\'T** downvote if you think OP is an asshole. **DON\'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH.** Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \n\nDon\'t participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. **Brigading will earn a permanent ban.**\n\n##3. Accept Your Judgment\n\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n\n##4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\n\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for **at least 48 hours**. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n\n##5. No Violence\n\nDon\'t even *mention* violence.\n\nIf your post or comment references violence, don\'t share it here. Any hint, mention, euphemism or suggestion of violence falls under this rule and isn\'t allowed.\n\nComments and even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone is strictly prohibited. **Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.**\n\n##6. How To Post\n\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\n\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don\'t link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can\'t explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else\'s account or a shared account.\n\n##7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\n\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\n\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n\n##8. No Shitposts\n\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\n\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn\'t a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\n\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n\n##9. Do Not Ask For Advice\n\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\n\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\n\nIf a thread\'s focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP\'s intent.\n\n##10. Updates and META posts are restricted\n\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed &amp; may result in a ban.\n\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the [update criteria](https://tinyurl.com/zn2kbnnw) for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\n \nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n\n##11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\n\nWe do not allow posts where the central conflict is about familial or platonic partings, relationships, and/or reproductive autonomy.\n\nThe following posts are forever banned:\n\nAITA for breaking up with/ghosting/cutting contact with _ (or not)\n\nAITA for dating _ (or not)\n\nAITA for doing sexual act _ (or not)\n\nAITA for being attracted to _ (or not)\n\nAny reproductive autonomy decision\n\nAny posts related to cheating- including \"telling on\" someone for cheating (or not).\n\nAnd similar.\n\n##12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\n\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you\'re ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\n\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n\n##13. No Revenge Stories\n\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you\'re here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you\'re probably breaking this rule.\n\n##14. No Medical Conflicts\n\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit\'s paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n\n\n___\n\n*Normal Rediquette applies*\n___\n\nFilters |||\n---|---|---\n[Assholes](https://goo.gl/xfq1zE)| [Not Assholes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair%3ANot+the+A-hole&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) | [Updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair:update&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) \n[Everyone Sucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair%3AEveryone+Sucks&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) | [No A-holes Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair%3ANo+A-holes+here&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) |  [Talks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/search?q=flair:talk&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) \n___', '2024-01-09 00:50:52', '2024-01-09 00:50:52'),

Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren\'t PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren\'t academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation.

When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don\'t mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don\'t make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner\'s location is allowed).\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.\n* Giveaways shouldn\'t last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.\n* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.\n* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.\n* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.\n\n---\n\nCheck the PCMR communities elsewhere:\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialPCMR)\n\n[Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPCMasterRace)\n\n[Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OfficialPCMR)\n\n[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/Officialpcmr/?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n[Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steampcmasterrace)\n\n[Steam Curator](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4771848-r-pcmasterrace-Group/ )\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pcmasterrace_official/)\n\n[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/officialpcmasterrace)\n\n---\n\nChats:\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/pcmr)\n\n---\n\nCharity: \n\n[Folding@Home](https://pcmasterrace.org/foldingteam)\n\n---\n\n#### [](#social)\n\n&gt; * [Website](https://pcmasterrace.org/ \"Website\")\n&gt; * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OfficialPCMR \"Twitter\")\n&gt; * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pcmr \"Discord\")\n&gt; * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pcmasterrace_official/ \"Instagram\")\n&gt; * [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/Officialpcmr/?sub_confirmation=1 \"YouTube\")\n&gt; * [Page](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPCMasterRace \"Facebook\")\n&gt; * [Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/OfficialPCMR \"Facebook\")\n&gt; * [Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steampcmasterrace \"Steam\")\n&gt; * [Curator](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4771848-r-pcmasterrace-Group/ \"Steam\")\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)', '2024-01-09 00:50:52', '2024-01-09 00:50:52'),

Posts must be relevant to the subreddit**\n\nThe principle of this subreddit is for posts to make the user question what the outcome or result will be. Your submission should convey a feeling of uncertainty.\n\nWe will remove posts that:\n\n* show significant violence, serious bodily harm or death (to human or animal).\n* contain political content.\n* have no discernible outcome.\n* contain text which explains the outcome of a video beforehand.\n\nWe understand that \"MaybeMaybeMaybe\" can be pretty subjective. Some posts will have more uncertainty, some less - and we\'ll keep this in mind when reviewing submissions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**2. Recent reposts within 2 months are not allowed**\n\nIn order to make sure content stays interesting and enjoyable we don\'t allow the same video or GIF to be posted within 2 months of the last time it was posted. \n\nCommon reposts may be removed independently of this limitation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**3. Keep posts/comments civil**\n\nPlease keep all posts and comments respectful and engage in civil discussion with other users. \n\nIf you believe a user is being unnecessarily toxic or hostile please refrain from retaliating or using insults and instead report it to avoid unintentionally breaking this rule yourself. \n\nSome of the things that are prohibited under this rule are but are not limited to:\n\n* targeted harassment or discrimination against users for their gender, sexuality, race, nationality or religion.\n* directing insults and other offensive remarks toward other users.\n* threatening, inciting, or encouraging physical harm or violence.\n* unwanted sexual comments.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**4. Submission Statement Required**\n\nOur subreddit bot, u/mmm-submission-bot, will request posters to reply within 15 minutes with a statement at least 50 characters in length explaining why the post is appropriate for this subreddit. Failure to reply to the bot will result in the removal of the post.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n____________\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis sub disguises the origin of the posts by replacing all titles with \"Maybe Maybe Maybe\".  If you prefer the \"original flavor\" (i.e. leaves the post titles alone) check out /r/maybemaybeoriginal.\n\nSource for /u/maybemaybemaybe_bot: [Github](https://github.com/lsowen/go-reddit-bot)\n\n&amp;nbsp;', '2024-01-09 00:50:52', '2024-01-09 00:50:52'),
